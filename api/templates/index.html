There are a couple of ways to try out the API:
<ul>
	<li>Use the index.html file in the client directory to access the API.</li>
	<li>Go to the search menu above and click one of the search links to see what JSON data is returned.</li>
	<li>On Linux, use curl from the command line for example:
		<pre>
		$> curl http://localhost:5000/customers/?search=Com
		[
		  "Company One", 
		  "Company Two", 
		  "Company Three", 
		  "A Company One", 
		  "A Company Two", 
		  "B Company One", 
		  "B Company Two"
		]
